<!--
	This config file defines the data packages that can be migrated to and
	from this database. A package is a set of one or more tables that are 
	always migrated in full every time they are moved. There are 2 ways to
	define a data package:
		
		1. For a single table package:
		
			<package name="mypackage" table="MyTable" />
			
			Where name is optional and will be defaulted to the name of the
			table if it is not present.
		
		2. For multiple table package:
		
			<package name="mypackage">
				<table>MyTable</table>
				<table>MyOtherTable</table>
			</package>
			
			Where name is required and one or more table elements are present.
